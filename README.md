## Please verify the code and use it if you'd like.


### I have created these files on Windows 10 64-bit OS using Windows Kit (i.e., CL.EXE, LINK.EXE and NMAKE.EXE).

The executable file here will run on the (CMD.exe) console in Windows 10 64-bit OS.


### Type the following command on directory util/ to make an executable file on directory util/bin/ out of C source files on directory util/bin/obj/src/.

> nmake T=<a-C-source-file-name-except-for-the-.c-extension>

e.g.,
> nmake T=cals

## Remarks

### When you build the code as it is, use the x64 native tools command prompt (e.g., for Visual Studio 2022).
